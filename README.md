# CSU Applied Category Theory Seminar Website

## How do I make changes?

Make changes either directly with the Web UI on the [repository](https://github.com/csu-applied-category-theory/csu-applied-category-theory) page, or locally with an editor after pulling. Push directly to the main branch and changes will be reflected in a minute.

Everything is in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), TeX formatting is [supported](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions).

## How do I get edit access?

Ask a seminar organizer to add you to the GitHub organization.
