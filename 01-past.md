| 3/25/2024	| James Wilson	| "TOPOS: How to code a set in a computer. Abstract:  For a century math folk have been getting away with saying things like ``Let a prime is number with exactly two factors.  For every prime p….''. In the first sentence we behave as though primes are a membership test P(n); so, S = { n \| P(n) }. In the second sentence we without explanation began to image primes are enumerated; so, S={2,3,5,…}. Obviously there is a computational gap in this change in behavior.  Mathematicians a century ago sought to fill it in by axiom. TOPOS is the name given to one strategy to close the gap in a computationally meaningful way. This means that if we write down a set in a TOPOS way, it has the ingredients to link membership with enumeration. I will lay out the motives and describe the three pillars upon which TOPOS can be defined and in the coming weeks we can build these pillars in math and in code." |

## Spring 2023

| Date | Speaker | <span style="display: inline-block; width:100%">Abstract</span>|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
|  January 24, 2023  | James Wilson | High level survey of Homotopy Type Theory |
|  January 31, 2023  | Ian Jorquera <br> Kylie Schnoor | Simple Types: $A \times B$ and $f: A \rightarrow B$ |

|  February 20, 2023 | Emily Riehl | **Title**: Homotopy type theory and univalent foundations <br> **Abstract**: This talk will introduce alternative foundations for mathematics in which "equality" becomes "identity," which is no longer a mere predicate but can carry structure. The primitive notion is called a "type," which can be interpreted as something like a set, or as something like a mathematical proposition, as a something like a groupoid or moduli space, which has higher structure. What Voevodsky named the "univalent foundations of mathematics" arose from a recently discovered homotopy theoretic interpretation of dependent type theory, originally designed as a formal system for constructive mathematics. We will introduce this formal system, explore Voevodsky's univalence axiom and its consequences, and discuss advantages for computer formalization. |
|  February 21, 2023 | Everyone | Post colloqium Q & A session |
|  March 7, 2023 | Chris Liu | Topos Tuesday - The Subobject Classifier and Logic in Topos <br> Resources: <br> [An Invitation to Applied Category Theory - Ch 7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05316.pdf) <br> [An informal introduction to topos theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.5647.pdf)|
|  April 25, 2023  | Kaylee Fantin&#8209;Hardesty <br> Sarah Lutz | **Title**: What Does it Mean for a Word to Have Meaning? Exploring Semantics in Natural Language Processing <br><br> **Abstract**: We will start by introducing several elementary solutions for attaching meaning to words in natural language processing, discuss the issues with those, and explore how we can "do better", i.e. how we can give words more meaning and be more computationally efficient. We end with an overview of Word2vec, a model that uses neural networks to learn word associations, which provides reasonably useful meanings for words. |
